# ShortestPath

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jeffreyvr/ShortestPath.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jeffreyvr/ShortestPath)

An unweighted shortest path algorithm. 

## Using Adjacency List

Uses Adjacency List because compared to a matrix, it takes up less space. 
For this implementation it is not needed to remove edges. 
If that was the case, it would be an argument in favor of the matrix.
